# Temporal - AI 
Prompts, et cetera for improving your Temporal experience.

## temporal-ai-prompt.md
Inspired by [Cloudflare's excellent example](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/prompting/), I usede Deep Research and GitHub connections to Temporal docs, Python SDK, and Python Samples to create a Temporal prompt.

There were a few places it seemed to be overfitting sample code that I corrected. I'm still refining my Temporal intuition, so I'm sure there is plenty of additional room for improvement.
Some anecdotal testing makes me think it's better than just relying on eg Sonnet 4's performance out of the box. I bet adding additional code samples would help too.
